    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Bo Kho is a spicy and flavorful Vietnamese beef stew that makes a pretty epic bowl of soup. At its most basic, it is considered a “beef stew,” given it can be prepared as a soup or a thicker stew. Bo Kho is flavored with chili, five-spice, fish sauce, lemongrass, plenty of garlic, and tomato. Its familiar red color comes from the addition of fragrant annatto.</p>
